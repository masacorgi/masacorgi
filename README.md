I'm a developer who values requirements analysis.
After graduating from Tech University of Korea, I learned backend development with the startup team Glow, using various Python frameworks. I enjoy working with AWS cloud platforms and have a deep understanding of NoSQL.

Key Strengths: Rapid integration, requirement identification, communication skills.

As a junior developer now, I believe most issues arise from unfamiliar technology and adapting to new project structures quickly. Recognizing and organizing requirements is crucial for problem-solving. Effective communication is essential, and I enjoy collaborative discussions with senior and peer team members.
